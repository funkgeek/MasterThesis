This repo includes data used in my master thesis.
In the "annotation" folder, it includes the annotated verbal art data.
The "mos" excel file is the collected results of questionnaire.
The "questionaire" excel file is the form sent to the participat to fill in.
The "问卷音频.zip“ is the packed original audio files and the generated audio files which are sent to participants for evaluation.
Because of the file size limitation of github, the code files can be found in this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p9xV0BJCFW4zGg0Y6KyPyAjI5MSg4e2Z?usp=sharing
